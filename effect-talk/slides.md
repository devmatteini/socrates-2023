# What is Effect?

Effect is a TypeScript library for building application with concurrency, error handling, observability and
composability...and many more things!

---

# Why Effect?

We are using `fp-ts` in production for a couple of years and we like it.

<br/>

At the end of february 2023, `fp-ts` was merged into the Effect ecosystem.

<br/>

Even if Effect 1.0 is far away, we've been using Effect in production since april/may <twemoji-rocket />!
